# Parsers
A parser is a file responsible for fetching data about the power system in a given region.

If you want to **create a new parser**, check out the [example.py](https://github.com/tmrowco/electricitymap-contrib/blob/master/parsers/example.py) file, or read the [instructions](https://github.com/tmrowco/electricitymap-contrib/blob/master/README.md#adding-a-new-country).

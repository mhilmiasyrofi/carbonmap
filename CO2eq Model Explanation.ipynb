    "All the electricity that is consumed somewhere must have been produced somewhere else. This gives us a *balance* equation, that can be applied to each zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for the $i$-th country, the following equality holds about electricity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ consumption_i = production_i + import_i - export_i - transmission_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now assume that transmission costs are negligible. Each term of the equation has an associated carbon intensity, which we will describe:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The carbon intensity of the consumption, denoted by $x_i$, is the one we are seeking to determine.\n",
    "- The carbon intensity of imports is the the carbon intensity of the zone exporting that power. If that zone is identified by the letter $j$, then carbon intensity of power imported from $j$ to $i$ is $x_j$.\n",
    "Therefore, the carbon intensity of exports from contry $i$ is naturally $x_i$.\n",
    "- If production is split up by production mode (i.e. power plant type), then each production mode $m$ has an associated intensity $I_{i,m}$ depending on its type of power plant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables us to write an updated balance equation for the carbon flow taking place in the $i$-th country, having imports from $j$, exports to $k$ and production modes $m$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_i \\cdot consumption_i = \\sum_m I_{i,m} \\cdot production_{i,m} + \\sum_j x_j \\cdot import_{i,j} - \\sum_k x_i \\cdot export_{i,k} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because in this simplified model $consumption = production + import - export$, exports cancel out, and the equation reduces to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_i \\left(\\sum_m production_{i,m} + \\sum_j import_{i,j} \\right) = \\sum_m I_{i,m} \\cdot production_i + \\sum_j x_j \\cdot import_{i,j}$$\n",
